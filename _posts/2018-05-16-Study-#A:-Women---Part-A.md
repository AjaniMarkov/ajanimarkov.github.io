<h1>
What Women Like To See In Men
</h1>

<h3>
1.) Being A Good Listener
</h3>

<p>
Girls like it when men listen to their problems,
it helps them vent and it shows them that the man cares about them. 
It is important to note that being a good listener does not mean that you should try to solve their problems. 
Sometimes it is OK for you to try to solve their problems, while it is not. 
The times of when it is OK and when it is not OK depend on the person. 
If you know the person well, react accordingly. 
If you don't know them well, then try your best to guess the answer. 
</p>

<h3>
2.) Being Confient (But Not Too Much) / Being Yourself
</h3>

<p>
What I mean is that you should try to be confident, both in yourself and in your actions, as women like that. 
What you should not do is being overconfient, such as being pushy or being a douchebag.
It is important to note that if you are known for not being that confient, then you should stay yourself, 
as that is a part of you and that is what women want, to date the person that asked them out/they asked out. 
</p>

<h3>
3.) Random Presents
</h3>

<p>
Women love it if you get them random presents for no reason whatsoever and at random times. 
It is impportant to note that there should be no schedule and no list of what to get them as a present. 
It should be completetly improvised, from how, when, and where. 
It is also important to note that the gift should be something they like, 
as it wouldn't make sense for them to be happy with something they dislike.
This shows them that you think about them a lot, and that you know what they like and don't like. 
It also shows them that you want them to be happy.
</p>

<h3>
4.) Smiling
</h3>

<p>
This one is pretty obvious. Why would a woman like someone who has a neutral or dead face all the time, 
even when the person they are supposed to love is right next to them? 
If you look straight into her eyes and smile, it shows her that you are happy to see her. 
And you should be, after all, you're in a relationship with her because you like her, don't you? 
Then shouldn't you be always happy when you're with her? 
Even taking into account the occasional fight you guys may have, overall, the relationship should be happy.
</p>

<h3>
5.) Kisses
</h3>

<p>
There are many different types and styles of kisses. 
Each one means something unique and uses various techniques and muscles to achieve the kiss and the sensation that comes with it. 
Here are all the ones that I know
</p>

<h4>
A.) Forehead
</h4>

<h4>
B.) Lips
</h4>

<h4>
C.) Cheeks
</h4>

<h5>
D.) 
</h5>

<h3>
Having A Good Sense Of Humor
</h3>

<p>
Most people like to laugh, and why wouldn't they? 
It's fun to laugh, and when you do, it triggers the release of endorphins. 
Not only that, but it does this while decreasing stress hormones, and boosting the immune system, decreasing blood pressure, 
improve circulation, exercising the muscles, etc. as shown by multiple studies.
Women are people too, and of course they like laughing too. 
This means that they're happier when they're with someone who can make them laugh. 
Not only that, but they like it more when someone can laugh at their jokes. 
Making them laugh as well as laughing at their jokes implies that you know each other well, 
and that you know what they will and will not laugh at.
